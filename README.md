# password-generator

## Description
For this project my assignment was to make a working password generator using JavaScript, I did this by using a for loop to select random characters from an array of all allowed characters. When the user goes on the page and clicks the red "Generate Password" button they will be given a series of confirms to select what types of characters they want in their password, and a prompt asking how many characters they want in their password. If the user selects a password length other than 8-128 characters they will be given an alert telling them their password must be at least 8 characters or no more than 128 and will be reprompted until they choose a length allowed.
